This R script generates all unique 3-node directed Boolean network graphs with self-loops allowed, ensuring each graph has at least two edges and all nodes are connected to at least one other (excluding isolated nodes). It uses BoolNet and igraph to create and mutate networks, filters out duplicates, and performs a triad census to group the graphs by structural motifs. The resulting graphs and their motif classifications are saved to a text file for further analysis in systems biology, network science, or machine learning.
